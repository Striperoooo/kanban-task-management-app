## What

This pull request adds a focused, small test suite that verifies the application's core business logic (the `BoardContext`) and a minimal smoke check of `BoardView` rendering. The intent is to protect the most important behaviors — board lifecycle, task CRUD, task movement, subtask toggles, and persistence — without testing every UI detail.

## Key outcomes

- Fast, deterministic unit tests for the `BoardContext` covering initialization, add/edit/delete of boards and tasks, intra- and cross-column moves, subtask toggles, and persistence calls.
- Three additional high-value tests for common regression areas: board deletion fallback + persistence, selected-board persistence on init, and a `BoardView` smoke test that confirms provider data renders in the UI.
- Storage helpers are mocked in tests to keep runs reliable and fast.

## Tests added / changed

- `src/contexts/BoardContext.test.tsx` — core mutators and persistence assertions (init, addBoard, addTask, editTask, deleteTask, moveTask (intra & cross), toggleSubtask). This file also contains the `Grabber` helper fixed to observe provider updates.
- `src/contexts/boardContext.extra.test.tsx` — new file with three high-value tests:
	- deleteBoard removes a board and selects a fallback board, and saveData is called
	- selectedBoardId from persisted load is respected on provider init
	- `BoardView` smoke test renders a task title from provider data
- `src/lib/storage.test.ts` — storage unit tests (existing) for load/save/clear and graceful handling of storage errors.
- `src/App.test.tsx` — small smoke assertion adjusted to match current UI labels.

## How to run

Run the suite locally:

```powershell
npm run test -- --run
```

Quick tips:

- During iterative development, omit `--run` to reuse the vite transform cache for faster feedback.
- Tests mock `src/lib/storage` by default; they are deterministic and do not touch real localStorage.

## Why these tests

Focusing on the `BoardContext` gives high signal-to-noise: most bugs with ordering, persistence, selection, and move semantics arise in the provider. By testing the provider directly we keep tests stable across UI refactors while validating behavior that affects the user experience.

## Next steps (optional)

- Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to run Vitest on commits/pull requests (I can add this if you want).
- Optionally add a small integration test for creating a board + verifying the sidebar updates if you want one more end-to-end smoke test.

## Checklist

- [x] Core `BoardContext` mutator tests (init, add/edit/delete/move, subtask toggles, persistence)
- [x] High-value tests (delete fallback + persist, selectedBoard init, BoardView smoke)
- [x] Keep tests deterministic by mocking storage helpers
- [ ] (Optional) Add CI workflow to run tests on push/PRs
