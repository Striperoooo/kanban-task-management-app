## What

Day 9 — Subtasks behavior & Task Details status

Implemented interactive subtasks in the Task Details modal (check/uncheck), live subtask progress count, and a functional status dropdown in the Task Details modal that can move a task between columns. Added a context method to toggle subtasks and kept the UI in sync by re-syncing the selected task when the board changes. Also improved keyboard accessibility for the subtask rows.

## Changes

- ✅ Subtask Toggle: Subtasks in the Task Details modal are now interactive checkboxes (click row or checkbox to toggle).
- ✅ Live Progress: Subtask completion count updates in real time (e.g. 0 of 3 → 1 of 3).
- ✅ Status Dropdown (in Details): Current Status is now a dropdown in the Task Details modal; changing it updates the task and moves it between columns when needed.
- ✅ Context API: Added `toggleSubtask(columnName, taskTitle, subtaskIndex)` in `BoardContext` to flip a subtask's `isCompleted` value and update `selectedBoard`.
- ✅ UI Sync: `Column` now re-finds/resyncs the selected task from `selectedBoard` when the board changes, keeping the modal view current (or closing it if the task was deleted).
- ✅ Accessibility: Subtask rows are keyboard accessible (Enter/Space toggles) and the checkbox input stops propagation to avoid double-toggle.
- ✅ Defensive code: Used nullish coalescing for `columns`/`tasks` where relevant to avoid runtime errors.

## How to Test

1. Checkout branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feat/subtasks
   ```
2. Install and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the app (e.g. http://localhost:5173/)
4. Subtask toggle:
   1. Open a board and open a task (Task Details modal).
   2. Click a subtask row (not just the checkbox) — it should toggle.
   3. Click the checkbox directly — it should toggle (and not double-toggle).
   4. Tab to a subtask row and press Enter or Space — it should toggle.
   5. Confirm the "Subtasks (X of Y)" count updates immediately.
5. Status change:
   1. In the same Task Details modal, change the "Current Status" dropdown to another column.
   2. Confirm the task is removed from the original column and appears in the target column.
   3. Confirm column task counts update accordingly.
6. Edge checks:
   1. Open a task, then delete it via the delete flow — the modal should close and the task be removed.
   2. Try toggling subtasks for tasks with no subtasks (nothing should crash).
7. Optional: run TypeScript check locally:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

## Files Changed

- `src/components/TaskDetailsModal.tsx` — interactive subtasks (checkbox + row click), keyboard handlers, status dropdown wired to `editTask`  
- `src/contexts/BoardContext.tsx` — added `toggleSubtask(columnName, taskTitle, subtaskIndex)` and exposed it via context  
- `src/components/Column.tsx` — set `selectedTask` with the column name when opening; added re-sync effect to refresh `selectedTask` from `selectedBoard` on updates

## Notes

- Current matching uses `task.title` to identify tasks (same approach as existing code). This works but is brittle if titles duplicate. Recommended follow-up: add stable `id` to tasks and refactor toggle/edit/delete to use `id`.
- Accessibility: the current implementation uses clickable list rows with keyboard handlers and stops propagation on the input. A more semantic pattern is to wrap checkbox + label in a native `<label>` (or use an input id) so the browser handles activation/focus/announcement natively. This is a small follow-up I can apply if you want.
- The code uses nullish coalescing (e.g., `(col.tasks ?? [])`) to avoid crashes when arrays are missing.

## Checklist

- [x] Subtasks are checkable (row + checkbox)  
- [x] Subtask completed count updates in real time  
- [x] Status dropdown in Task Details updates/moves task to target column  
- [x] `toggleSubtask` added to `BoardContext`  
- [x] Column re-sync keeps modal data fresh (or closes modal if task deleted)  
- [x] Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space) for subtask rows  
- [x] TypeScript compiles cleanly (please run `npx tsc --noEmit` locally)  
- [ ] Add stable `id` to tasks and refactor matching to use id (recommended follow-up)  
- [ ] Add unit tests for `toggleSubtask` and `editTask` move behavior (optional)  
- [ ] ESLint passes without warnings (you can run `npm run lint` to confirm)

Merge after review and run the manual tests above. If you want, I can also:
- Convert everything to stable task `id` matching (safer), or
- Replace list-row handlers with native label-based patterns for slightly better accessibility.
